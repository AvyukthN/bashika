# Bashika
Bashika is a series of programming languages I am developing in C/C++. I started working on a LISP implementation to get familiar with C and once I felt I had I moved on to a tree walk interpreter in C++ (which I am currently working on). Bytecode Virtual Machine COMING SOON!!!!

## Installation

Clone the github and get started with it! (not much code has been written so I will update this when I have a full implementation you can play with)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvyukthN/bashika```

## Usage

COMING SOON
```
